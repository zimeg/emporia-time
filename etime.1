.TH ETIME "1" "2025-03-17" "etime 1.1.2" "etime Manual"
.
.SH NAME
etime \- The \fBtime\fP command, with energy awareness.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
etime [\fIflags\fP] <\fIcommand\fP> [\fIargs\fP]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBetime\fP program invokes the provided \fIcommand\fP while gathering details about timing and energy usage.
.sp 2
Options for this program are provided as \fIflags\fP before the \fIcommand\fP.
.sp 2
Arguments for the provided \fIcommand\fP should follow the \fIcommand\fP as separate \fIargs\fP. These values can represent flags or positional arguments and are provided to \fIcommand\fP when it is executed.
.sp 2
The resulting measurements from \fIcommand\fP follow outputs from execution and include:
.
.IP "real"
Actual execution time from start to finish.
.
.IP "user"
CPU time executing in user mode for the process.
.
.IP "sys"
CPU time making system calls in kernel mode.
.
.IP "joules"
Total energy used during the command duration.
.
.IP "watts"
Average power output over the command duration.
.
.IP "sure"
Ratio of observed-to-expected usage results.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.IP "-h, --help"
Print a helpful but brief message.
.
.IP "-p, --portable"
Output measurements on separate lines for quick parsing.
.
.IP "--device <string>"
Configure the name or ID of the smart plug to measure.
.
.IP "--username <string>"
Account username for Emporia.
.
.IP "--password <string>"
Account password for Emporia.
.
.IP "--version"
Respond with the current version of the build.
.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
An exit code of \fB0\fP is returned when both \fBetime\fP and the \fIcommand\fP exit with success.
.sp 2
Failure to reach the smart plug servers or execute the built-in \fBtime\fP command will cause the \fBetime\fP program to exit with a non-zero status code.
.sp 2
The \fIcommand\fP might exit with an error code that will be returned after gathering usage measurements.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
.IP "EMPORIA_DEVICE"
The name or ID of the smart plug to measure.
.
.IP "EMPORIA_USERNAME"
The account username for Emporia.
.
.IP "EMPORIA_PASSWORD"
The account password for Emporia.
.
.IP "XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
The path to a directory for storing configurations.
.
.
.SH FILES
.
.IP "$HOME/.config/etime/settings.json"
Details about the active device and service tokens.
.
.
.SH STANDARDS
The built-in \fBtime\fP command must have the \fB-p\fP option to ouput timing measurements on separate lines.
.sp 2
That \fBtime\fP command also must print to \fBstderr\fP. Per \fBPOSIX.1\fP.
