# Contributors guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This is pretty exciting!

All types of contributions are valued and encouraged, so feel free to get
involved however you'd like! Just please abide by the [code of conduct][conduct]
in any interactions.

## Submitting issues

Any problems with the code can be reported from [the **Issues** tab][issues].
Security related concerns should be shared on [the **Security** tab][security].

When submitting an issue, please provide enough detail to observe the problem.
Any related information is appreciated too!

Highlighting issues is very useful for stable software, so thank you.

Fixes for any open issues are always welcomed by opening a pull request.

## Suggesting enhancements

Features that modify existing behavior or add new functionality to suit your own
needs are encouraged!

Discussion around any changes can happen either on a pull request or an issue
beforehand to help align with the general goals of this project.

Any miscellaneous musings or random ideations are always so appreciated.

## Improving code health

Any efforts to make this project better are also welcomed! These can include
changes or additions to documentation, testing, or other things related to code.

These changes can usually be proposed directly in a pull request.

The code is so grateful for these changes.

## Opening pull requests

Proposing any changes might be intimidating, but we're all on the same team!

After you have [created a fork][fork] and made your changes, there are a few
additional checks before opening a pull request:

- Add an entry to the `CHANGELOG.md` – something brief but descriptive
- Write tests that cover common cases for any changes to the code
- Ensure all documentation is updated – both `godoc` and the outward kinds

Once this looks good to you, [create a pull request][fork_pr] with the following
information:

- A title that summarizes the goal of the changes, formatted as a
  [conventional commit][commit]
- A summary of the changes and any notes, as needed

And with that, you can open the pull request and wait for a review! Woo! Go you!
